## Introduction

Develop several variants of a 30-second elevator speech and insert one of those variants here and so that people know whether or not to read/listen to the rest of your presentation

It is extremely important that you do not try to appeal to everyone ... you must CONNECT one-to-one with the key people you want in your audience.  

You obviously do not have time to waste with every single human on the planet -- realistically, you can probably only reach a few thousand with a good video and far fewer than that with a 20-minute in-person pitch.  Appeal ONLY to your specific audience and make sure that you qualify your audience before wasting their time or yours.  Focus only on those who will be ready, willing and able help you after hearing your pitch.

## Need For Product/Service

Convince your audience that you *really* understand the problem and the root cause of the problem better than anyone else?  Explain your solution, but only enough to illustrate why anyone would **need** YOUR product or service.    

## Value Proposition to Target Clients or Customers

You must have a maniacal focus on serving your customers.  Loyal customers are the only asset any business ever has ... what is your value proposition to customers and why will these customers STICK with you. 

Make it clear that you know EXACTLY what your target customer demographic/psychographic is. Explain how you have already engaged with customers from this population. How many of these people have you engaged? What have your customers told you? How are you expanding your level and scope of engagement? What are you going to do for these customers that will fuel the scaling of your company?

## Technology, Methodology, Innovation

What is the technology behind the product?  What is the methodology for producing the product? Explain your particular secret sauce or magic and what you are doing to develop your next recipes for secret sauce.

## Competitive Industry Analysis

What are you doing to gather competitive industry business intelligence?  Demonstrate that you have thoroughly developed a network that extends throughout your industry and are working to understand the competition even more thoroughly.  

## Leadership Advantage

Beyond just your current secret sauce, what is your dynamic leadership advantage in this space?  How are you going to be better tomorrow than you are today?  How are you going to accelerate your development of your leadership advantage?  What is your plan for learning, training, getting tougher?

## Marketing Plan

How do you use different avenues, especially taking advantage of social media, APIs, version-controlled content repositories and other distributed platforms to spread the word, evangelize followers, to get others to do your PR and marketing.

One person cannot implement a marketing plan alone.  Explain how are you building the foundation for OTHERS to spread the word.  "There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if he actually looks like a salesman, he’s probably bad at sales and worse at tech.”  Peter Thiel and Blake Masters (2014-09-16). Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future.

## Management Analysis

Every single day anyone in business must ask the seven key questions that every business must answer:

- **Timing** Is NOW the right time to research OR plan OR develop OR launch OR scale OR pivot OR shelve your particular business idea?
- **Engineering** What is the breakthrough technology or methodology you have created beyond just incremental improvements?
- **Monopoly** Are you starting with a big share of a small market?  How can you change your idea to be the ONLY good alternative?
- **People** Do you have the right team?  How can you get a better team?  How will you develop your team to always be the best?
- **Distribution** Do you have a way to not just create but produce, deliver, distribute, evangelize your product?
- **Durability** How will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? How will you defend your position?
- **Secret** Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?  What is the secret to how you found your secret?

The answers change a bit every single day.  The management task for each day is basically a matter of working through the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats related to each of these seven big questions.

The makeup of the people on your management team should illustrate how you have management analysis covered, but it is also important to be humble.  Do not be afraid to discuss weaknesses or stumbles and what you are doing to correct the issues.  The discussion of management is a story of emergence; it is not a celebration of past accomplishments. 

## Financial Analysis -- Think WIN-WIN-WIN

Your business needs to cash flow right away.  An infusion of cash might help you to expand, but why should investors invest -- what is the exit strategy for an investor; what kind of return will the investor get out of your company?  

Maybe you are not looking for investors, but financial analysis is necessary for the business owner and it is also important for convince other key potential employees or partners of the sustainability of the enterprise. What is in it for an employee or partner?  

Financial analysis boils down to making sure that your enterprise represents a WIN-WIN-WIN scenario for multiple OTHER people ... GOOD customers will support your company with purchases and also refer others [not just customers, but potential employees, partners, investors] to a financially sustainable company with a solid product ... good people with talent will join you and *put their shoulder to the wheel* building the company if your enterprise a financially sustainable company ... patient investors and solid business partners will give your company resources if they can see a return from participating in expanding a financially sustainable company.  

If your financial analysis does not paint a WIN-WIN-WIN picture for customers, employees, partners, investors, you need to go back to the drawing board and rethink your plan.

## Summary—Call to Action

By the time you have gotten to the tenth slide, you should have created the impression of unstoppable success. The only think left to do is to discribe EXACTLY what you need from your particular audience.  

You call to action will not only change with the audience, but it needs to change over time.  Solid businesses continually simplify and sharpening the focus their entire business by enlisting the support of key people who can advance the cause.
